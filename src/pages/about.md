# About Me

Hey, my name is Daniil Kim.

I'm a Software Engineer. I am from Kazakhstan, the city of Karaganda.

I have large practical experience in effective coding of web applications. Basically I work with frontend. I took part in development of small startups, as well as large high-loaded projects. Over the years I've gained hands-on experience in both developing applications from scratch and supporting existing products in large teams. And all these years I try to learn something new every day, to develop and to get better.

I studied at Karaganda Higher Polytechnic College and upon graduation received a bachelor's degree in computer science.

The most important thing for me is to work on the product with real users, rather than mindlessly writing code.
