# About Me

Hi, my name is Daniil Kim.

I'm 18 y.o. And I'm a Frontend Developer at [SimpleCode](http://simplecode.kz). I am from Kazakhstan, the city of Karaganda. I speak Russian and a little English.

I have been programming since was 14 y.o and developing a frontend for more than 2 years. My programming experience is more than 4 years, of which more than a year is commercial. Over the years, I have had practical experience in both developing web applications from scratch and supporting existing products in large teams. And all these years, every day i try to learn something new, develop and just get better.

Now i'm a 4th year student at the Karaganda Higher Polytechnic College. Represented my college at hackathons among students from all over Kazakhstan.
