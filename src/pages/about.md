# About Me

Hi, my name is Daniil Kim.

I'm 18 y.o. And I'm a Frontend Developer at [Jusan](https://jusan.kz/). I am from Kazakhstan, the city of Karaganda. I speak Russian and a little English.

I have been programming since was 14 y.o and developing a frontend for more than 2 years. My programming experience is more than 4 years, of which more than 2 years is commercial. Over the years, I have had practical experience in both developing web applications from scratch and supporting existing products in large teams. And all these years, every day i try to learn something new, develop and just get better.

Now i'm a 4th year student at the Karaganda Higher Polytechnic College. Represented my college at hackathons among students from all over Kazakhstan.

The main thing for me is to work on the product with real users, and not mindlessly write code.
