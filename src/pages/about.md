# About Me

Hey there! I'm Daniil Kim, a Software Engineer based in Karaganda, Kazakhstan.

## What I Do

I specialize in frontend development with extensive hands-on experience building web applications that matter. Over the years, I've worked across the spectrum — from early-stage startups to large-scale, high-traffic projects.

My experience includes:

- Building from scratch → Taking ideas from concept to production
- Team collaboration → Working effectively in large development teams
- Legacy systems → Maintaining and improving existing codebases
- Performance optimization → Ensuring applications scale under load

## Background

I graduated from Karaganda Higher Polytechnic College with a bachelor's degree in Computer Science. But my real education happens every day — I'm constantly learning new technologies, patterns, and approaches to stay current in this fast-evolving field.

## Philosophy

The most important thing for me is building products that serve real users. Code is just a tool; what matters is solving actual problems and creating experiences that people find valuable.

I believe in writing clean, maintainable code that other developers can understand and extend. Good software isn't just about working features — it's about sustainable systems that can grow and adapt over time.
