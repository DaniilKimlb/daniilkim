# About me #

Hey, my name is Daniil Kim.

I'm 18 years old, and I work as a Software Engineer at [Jusan](https://jusan.kz/). I am from Kazakhstan, the city of Karaganda. I speak Russian and English.

I have large practical experience in effective coding of web applications. Basically I work with frontend. I took part in development of small startups, as well as large high-loaded projects. Over the years I've gained hands-on experience in both developing applications from scratch and supporting existing products in large teams. And all these years I try to learn something new every day, to develop and to get better.

Now I am a 4th year student of Karaganda Higher Polytechnic College. I represented my college at hackathons among students from all over Kazakhstan.

The most important thing for me is to work on the product with real users, rather than mindlessly writing code.
